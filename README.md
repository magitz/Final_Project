# Project 2

## Group project

This is a group project. You should work in groups of 2 to 4 (not alone and not more than 4). If this is a problem, please let me know ahead of time.

## Requirements

The following are required elements of the final script(s) that are turned in:

* The script should read from a file or use a web service or read a web page.
* The script should have at least one each of the following flow control elements:
  * `for` or `while` loop
  * `if` statement
  * You must define and use at least two functions
  * You must `import` at least one module (e.g., `os`, `re`, `argparse`, `numpy`, `pandas`, etc.)
  * You must write something to a file

## What to do

You may choose one of the following for what your script does as long as it meets the above criteria.

* Write a script to analyze the flight data from PS2. You can choose what you want to analyze, or ask for help if you can't think of anything.
* Write a script to query an API and display some result of your interest. In the Web Services class, I pointed out [this list of public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis), there are others. If you have an idea, I can try to help find a data source and API.
* Write a script that does anything of your choice. This is kind of wide open, but remember the criteria above. Each of those criteria must be satisfied in your script for full points.
